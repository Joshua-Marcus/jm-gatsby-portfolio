## Building your site ðŸ“¦

As we are dealing with environment variables, the `.env` file is excluded from `.gitignore` file. Therefore, in order to deploy the website you have to send `SPACE_ID` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` with the `build` command.

```bash
SPACE_ID=xxxxx ACCESS_TOKEN=yyyyy yarn build
```

The result will be stored inside the `public` folder, so you can upload to your web host. I highly suggest using this starter with Netlify when you can define which command will build the project and also send the environment variables inside the website configuration.


## Tracking with Google Analytics (Optional) ðŸ“ˆ

This starter has the analytics plugin inside the `gatsby-config`, so the only need to do in order to enable it is to provide the `Tracking Id` for your site (starts with `UA-`). Just set a new variable inside your `.env` file called `ANALYTICS_ID` and analytics will be turn on automatically ðŸ˜„
